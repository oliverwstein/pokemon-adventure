## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with end-of-turn effects** - This foundational system affects multiple existing features
2. **Implement basic move effects** - Focus on the most common effects first (status infliction, stat changes)
3. **Add active conditions system** - This enables more complex move interactions
4. **Expand move data** - Create RON files and implement remaining move effects
5. **Polish and test** - Add comprehensive testing and improve code quality

The TODO list prioritizes core battle functionality that affects multiple systems, then moves to specific move implementations, and finally addresses polish and completeness features.
