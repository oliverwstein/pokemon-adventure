# Pokemon Adventure Battle System TODO

## High Priority - Core Battle System Features

### End-of-Turn Effects System
- [x] Implement status damage (poison, burn) during end-of-turn phase
- [x] Add status time timers (sleep has a duration set when it begins, poison worsens each turn)
- [ ] Handle trapped Pokemon effects (bind, wrap, fire spin)
    - The data structures are in place: PokemonCondition::Trapped exists in player.rs, and its timer is correctly decremented in tick_active_conditions. However, the core logic to apply damage during the end-of-turn phase is missing from execute_end_turn_phase and it does not prevent switching as it ought (TODO).
- [ ] Implement leech seed draining
    - The PokemonCondition::Seeded enum exists, but there is no logic in execute_end_turn_phase to handle the HP draining from the target and healing the user.

### Move Effects Implementation
#### (This relates to moves causing effects, not implementing the effects themselves)

- [ ] **Rest**: User sleeps for set turns but fully heals HP and status
- [ ] **Bide**: Store damage for set turns, then release double
- [ ] **Rage**: Enter rage mode with attack boosts when hit
- [ ] **Rampage**: Multi-turn uncontrollable attack with confusion/exhaustion

#### Field Effects
- [ ] **Haze**: Remove all stat stage changes from all Pokemon
- [ ] **Reflect**: Reduce physical or special damage for team
- [ ] **Mist**: Prevent stat reductions for team

#### Utility Effects
- [ ] **Heal**: Restore percentage of user's max HP
- [ ] **CureStatus**: Remove specific status condition from target
- [ ] **Ante**: Gain money after battle (Pay Day effect)

### Active Pokemon Conditions System
- [x] **Flinched**: Prevents Pokemon from taking action for one turn
- [x] **Confused**: Chance to hurt self instead of using move, with turn counter
- [ ] **Seeded**: Takes damage each turn that heals the opponent (leech seed)
- [ ] **Underground**: Invulnerable to most moves while underground (dig mechanics)
- [ ] **InAir**: Invulnerable to most moves while in air (fly mechanics)
- [ ] **Teleported**: Prevents user from being hit, but does not prevent status moves (custom feature)
- [ ] **Enraged**: Attack boost accumulation for rage mechanics
- [x] **Exhausted**: Skip next turn (after hyper beam, etc.)

- [ ] Add proper move descriptions and flavor text

### AI Improvements
- [ ] Smarter move selection beyond "first available"
- [ ] Type effectiveness consideration in AI
- [ ] Switch decision logic for AI

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for all move effects
- [ ] Integration tests for complex battle scenarios  
- [ ] Performance testing for large battle sequences

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor large functions into smaller components
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for edge cases

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with end-of-turn effects** - This foundational system affects multiple existing features
2. **Implement basic move effects** - Focus on the most common effects first (status infliction, stat changes)
3. **Add active conditions system** - This enables more complex move interactions
4. **Expand move data** - Create RON files and implement remaining move effects
5. **Polish and test** - Add comprehensive testing and improve code quality

The TODO list prioritizes core battle functionality that affects multiple systems, then moves to specific move implementations, and finally addresses polish and completeness features.
