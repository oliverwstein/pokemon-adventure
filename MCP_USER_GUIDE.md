# Pokemon Adventure MCP Server - User Guide

## Overview

The Pokemon Adventure MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLMs with access to a complete Pokemon battle engine featuring authentic Generation 1 mechanics. This guide explains how to use the various tools available through the MCP server.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain installed
- Clone the Pokemon Adventure repository

### Building the MCP Server
```bash
cd pokemon-adventure
cargo build --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp
```

The binary will be located at `target/debug/pokemon-adventure-mcp` (or `target/release/pokemon-adventure-mcp` for release builds).

### Testing the MCP Server

Before configuring with Claude, you can test the server directly:

```bash
# Test server initialization
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}' | cargo run --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp

# Test getting available tools
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | cargo run --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp

# Test getting available teams
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_available_teams", "arguments": {}}}' | cargo run --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp
```

### Configuration for Claude Code

**Option 1: Using Claude CLI (Recommended)**

First, ensure the MCP server binary is built:
```bash
cd pokemon-adventure
cargo build --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp --release
```

Then configure the MCP server. There are three approaches that work:

**Method A: Using pre-built binary (Most Reliable)**
```bash
claude mcp add pokemon-adventure "/full/path/to/pokemon-adventure/target/release/pokemon-adventure-mcp"
```

**Method B: Using cargo with directory change**
```bash
claude mcp add pokemon-adventure "cd /full/path/to/pokemon-adventure && cargo run --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp --release"
```

**Method C: Using cargo from correct directory**
```bash
cd pokemon-adventure
claude mcp add pokemon-adventure "cargo run --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp --release"
```

Replace `/full/path/to/pokemon-adventure` with the actual absolute path to your pokemon-adventure directory.

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**

**Step 1: Locate Configuration File**
The Claude Code MCP configuration file location depends on your operating system:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Step 2: Add MCP Server Configuration**
Add or update the configuration file with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokemon-adventure": {
      "command": "cargo",
      "args": ["run", "--bin", "pokemon-adventure-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/full/path/to/pokemon-adventure"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/full/path/to/pokemon-adventure` with the actual absolute path to your pokemon-adventure directory.

**Step 3: Restart Claude Code**
After saving the configuration file, you MUST completely restart Claude Code for the MCP server to be loaded and the tools to become available.

**Step 4: Verify Configuration**
```bash
claude mcp list
```

Should show:
```
pokemon-adventure: /path/to/pokemon-adventure/target/release/pokemon-adventure-mcp - ‚úì Connected
```

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If the connection shows `‚úó Failed to connect`, try these solutions:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Binary not found**: 
   - Verify the binary exists: `ls -la target/release/pokemon-adventure-mcp`
   - Build it first: `cargo build --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp --release`

2. **Wrong binary name**:
   - The correct binary name is `pokemon-adventure-mcp` (not `mcp_client_server`)
   - Check available binaries: `cargo build --bin pokemon-adventure-mcp 2>&1 | grep "Available bin targets"`

3. **Working directory issues**:
   - Use absolute paths in the configuration
   - Method A (pre-built binary) avoids working directory issues entirely

4. **Cargo command not found**:
   - Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed and in PATH
   - Use Method A (pre-built binary) to avoid cargo dependencies

5. **Connection timeout**:
   - The MCP server needs proper JSON-RPC initialization
   - Direct binary execution (Method A) is most reliable

### Verification Steps

After successful configuration, test the connection:
```bash
# Check server status
claude mcp list

# Get server details
claude mcp get pokemon-adventure

# Should show "‚úì Connected" status
```

If still having issues:
1. Remove and re-add the server: `claude mcp remove pokemon-adventure`
2. Use Method A (pre-built binary) for most reliable connection
3. Ensure the pokemon-adventure directory has proper permissions
4. Restart Claude Code completely after configuration changes

## Battle Flow

### Starting a Battle
1. Use `get_available_teams` to see your options
2. Use `start_battle` with your team choice (1-3)
3. Use `get_battle_state` to see the initial setup

### During Battle  
1. Use `check` tools to assess the situation
2. Use `use_move` or `switch_pokemon` to take actions
3. Use `lookup_move` or `lookup_pokemon` for strategic information
4. Use `get_battle_state` to see results after each turn

### Battle End
- Battles end automatically when all Pokemon on one side faint
- Use `forfeit_battle` to quit early if needed
- Start a new battle anytime with `start_battle`

## Tips for LLM Users

### Strategic Information Gathering
- **Research moves**: Use `lookup_move` to understand power, accuracy, and special effects
- **Know your opponent**: Use `check opponent` to see their Pokemon's status and type
- **Plan switches**: Use `check team` to see your available Pokemon and their conditions

### Effective Battle Commands
- **Be specific with move names**: "Use Hydro Pump" rather than "use a water attack"
- **Use exact Pokemon numbers**: "Switch to Pokemon 3" rather than "switch to another Pokemon" 
- **Check status regularly**: Use `get_battle_state` to stay informed about HP and status conditions

### Example Battle Session
```
LLM: "What teams are available?"
‚Üí get_available_teams

LLM: "I'll choose the Venusaur team to start a battle"  
‚Üí start_battle with team_choice: 1

LLM: "What's my Pokemon's current status?"
‚Üí check with target: "self"

LLM: "Let me see what moves my opponent might use"
‚Üí lookup_pokemon with species_name: "Charizard"

LLM: "I'll use Sleep Powder to put them to sleep"
‚Üí use_move with move_name: "Sleep Powder"

LLM: "How did that turn go?"
‚Üí get_battle_state
```
