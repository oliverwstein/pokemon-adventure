3. Use `get_battle_state` to see the initial setup

### During Battle  
1. Use `check` tools to assess the situation
2. Use `use_move` or `switch_pokemon` to take actions
3. Use `lookup_move` or `lookup_pokemon` for strategic information
4. Use `get_battle_state` to see results after each turn

### Battle End
- Battles end automatically when all Pokemon on one side faint
- Use `forfeit_battle` to quit early if needed
- Start a new battle anytime with `start_battle`

## Tips for LLM Users

### Strategic Information Gathering
- **Research moves**: Use `lookup_move` to understand power, accuracy, and special effects
- **Know your opponent**: Use `check opponent` to see their Pokemon's status and type
- **Plan switches**: Use `check team` to see your available Pokemon and their conditions

### Effective Battle Commands
- **Be specific with move names**: "Use Hydro Pump" rather than "use a water attack"
- **Use exact Pokemon numbers**: "Switch to Pokemon 3" rather than "switch to another Pokemon" 
- **Check status regularly**: Use `get_battle_state` to stay informed about HP and status conditions

### Example Battle Session
```
LLM: "What teams are available?"
‚Üí get_available_teams

LLM: "I'll choose the Venusaur team to start a battle"  
‚Üí start_battle with team_choice: 1

LLM: "What's my Pokemon's current status?"
‚Üí check with target: "self"

LLM: "Let me see what moves my opponent might use"
‚Üí lookup_pokemon with species_name: "Charizard"

LLM: "I'll use Sleep Powder to put them to sleep"
‚Üí use_move with move_name: "Sleep Powder"

LLM: "How did that turn go?"
‚Üí get_battle_state
```
