# **Implementation Roadmap: Command-Based Turn Orchestrator**

## **üéØ CURRENT STATUS: ATTACK SYSTEM COMPLETE - SPECIAL MOVES REMAINING**

**Date**: December 2024  
**Achievement**: Successfully completed attack system refactoring from imperative mutation-heavy design to command-based pattern  
**Test Results**: **131/131 tests passing (100%)**  
**Architecture**: Full separation of intent (commands) from execution with pure functional calculations for attack moves

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Attack System Refactoring**
The `execute_attack_hit` function has been fully transformed to use command-based architecture.

### **üîÑ REMAINING WORK: Special Moves & Forced Actions**
- `perform_special_move` function still uses imperative mutation patterns
- Forced action logic needs command-based refactoring
- Complex special moves (Transform, Substitute, Bide, etc.) need pure calculation functions

---

## **üèÜ ATTACK SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (COMPLETE)**

The attack system refactoring has been **100% completed**. The `execute_attack_hit` function has been fully "hollowed out" and now serves as a simple coordinator that delegates all game logic to the pure `calculate_attack_outcome` function and all state mutation to the `execute_commands_locally` bridge.

### **Final `execute_attack_hit` Implementation**

```rust
pub fn execute_attack_hit(
    attacker_index: usize,
    defender_index: usize,
    move_used: Move,
    hit_number: u8,
    action_stack: &mut ActionStack,
    bus: &mut EventBus,
    rng: &mut TurnRng,
    battle_state: &mut BattleState,
) {
    // 1. Guard Clause: If the defender is already fainted (from a previous hit in a
    //    multi-hit sequence), the entire action is silently stopped.
    if battle_state.players[defender_index]
        .active_pokemon()
        .map_or(true, |p| p.is_fainted())
    {
        return;
    }

    // 2. Calculation: Delegate ALL game logic to the pure calculator function.
    //    This single call determines everything that should happen as a result of the attack.
    let commands = calculate_attack_outcome(
        battle_state, 
        attacker_index, 
        defender_index, 
        move_used, 
        hit_number, 
        rng
    );
    
    // 3. Execution: Pass the resulting list of commands to the executor bridge.
    //    This step applies all the calculated state changes and emits all events.
    if let Err(e) = execute_commands_locally(commands, battle_state, bus, action_stack) {
        eprintln!("Error executing attack commands: {:?}", e);
        // In a real application, this might warrant more robust error handling.
    }
}
```

### **Complete `calculate_attack_outcome` Functionality**

The calculator now handles **ALL** attack-related logic:

1. **Hit/Miss Logic**: Accuracy calculations, MoveUsed/MoveHit/MoveMissed events
2. **Type Effectiveness**: Complete type chart with proper multipliers and events
3. **Critical Hit System**: Speed-based critical hit rates with events
4. **Damage Calculation**: Both special and normal damage with STAB and type effectiveness
5. **Substitute Protection**: HP management, destruction, and event generation
6. **Move Effects Application**: All 15+ move effects (Burn, Paralyze, Freeze, Poison, Sleep, Flinch, Confuse, Trap, Exhaust, StatChange, RaiseAllStats, Heal, Haze, CureStatus, Reflect/Light Screen)
7. **Damage-Based Effects**: Recoil and Drain effects with proper calculations
8. **Miss-Based Effects**: Reckless effect recoil on missed attacks
9. **Multi-Hit Logic**: Probabilistic multi-hit sequences with proper action queuing
10. **All Event Generation**: Complete event emission for logging and testing

### **Key Bug Fixes Completed**

1. **Multi-Hit Logic Bug**: Fixed guaranteed hit counting (`hit_number + 1 < guaranteed_hits`)
2. **Action Queuing Bug**: Fixed PushAction to use `push_front` instead of `push_back`
3. **Multi-Hit Fainting Bug**: Proper defender faint check prevents invalid subsequent hits
4. **Substitute Integration**: Proper integration with all move effect systems

### **Architecture Achievements**

- **Pure Functional Calculator**: No side effects, deterministic, testable
- **Command-Based Execution**: Clear separation of intent from execution
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive logging maintained
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: All existing tests continue to pass
- **Maintainable Code**: Clean helper functions and clear separation of concerns

## **üéØ NEXT PHASE: SPECIAL MOVES & FORCED ACTIONS**

### **Remaining Functions to Refactor**

1. **`perform_special_move` Function** - Located in `src/battle/turn_orchestrator.rs`
   - Currently handles complex special moves with direct state mutation
   - Needs transformation to command-based pattern like `execute_attack_hit`
   - Special moves include: Transform, Substitute, Bide, Counter, Teleport, etc.

2. **Forced Action Logic**
   - Multi-turn moves that create forced actions for subsequent turns
   - Action stack management for complex move sequences
   - Integration with existing command system

### **Architecture Goals for Next Phase**
- Create `calculate_special_move_outcome()` pure function
- Transform `perform_special_move` into simple coordinator
- Maintain 131/131 test compatibility throughout refactoring
- Complete separation of intent from execution for all battle logic

---

## **üìÅ REMOVED LEGACY FUNCTIONS (ATTACK SYSTEM)**

The following functions were successfully migrated and removed:
- `apply_move_effects()` - ~30 lines (moved to calculator)
- `apply_on_damage_effects()` - ~30 lines (moved to calculator)
- Legacy imperative logic from `execute_attack_hit` - ~120 lines removed
